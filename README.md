# KafkaBundle

This is a fork from Md6Web Kafka Bundle to introduce new features and supports Symfony 4.

Configuration and use of KafkaBundle are based on the [RdKafka extension](https://arnaud-lb.github.io/php-rdkafka/phpdoc/book.rdkafka.html). 
To consume messages, we decided to use the high level consumer.

[Kafka documentation](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html)

## Installation

### For Symfony ###

Install the bundle:

```
$ composer require widicorp/kafka-bundle
```

## Usage ##

Add the `widicorp_kafka` section in your configuration file.

By default, the symfony event dispatcher will throw an event on each command. To disable this feature: 

```yaml
widicorp_kafka:
   event_dispatcher: false
```   

Here a configuration example: 

[Librdkafka global configuration properties](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md)

```yaml
widicorp_kafka:
    services_name_prefix: 'custom_prefix'
    event_dispatcher: true
    producers:
       producer1:
           configuration:
               timeout.ms: 1000
               queue.buffering.max.ms: 0 # Maximum time, in milliseconds, for buffering data on the producer queue. 1000ms by default. 
           brokers:
               - '127.0.0.1'
               - '10.05.05.19'
           log_level: 3
           events_poll_timeout: 2000 #ms
           topics:
               batman:
                   configuration:
                       retries: 3
                   strategy_partition: 2
               catwoman:
                   configuration:
                       retries: 3
                   strategy_partition: 2

    consumers:
        consumer1:
            configuration:
                metadata.broker.list: '127.0.0.1'
                group.id: 'myConsumerGroup'
                enable.auto.commit: 0
            topicConfiguration:
                auto.offset.reset: 'smallest'
            timeout_consuming_queue: 200
            message_handler: 'App\Consumer\MyService'
            topics:
                - batman
                - catwoman
```

Note that we decided to use the high level consumer. 
So you can set the "group.id" option in the consumer configuration.

```yaml
configuration:
  metadata.broker.list: '127.0.0.1'
  group.id: 'myConsumerGroup'
```

For the producers, we have one topic configuration for each topic:
```yaml
 topics:
   batman:
       configuration:
           retries: 3
       strategy_partition: '2'
   catwoman:
       configuration:
           retries: 3
       strategy_partition: '2'
 ```

Whereas for the consumers, we have one topic configuration for all topics:
```yaml
topicConfiguration:
    auto.offset.reset: 'smallest'
timeout_consuming_queue: 200
message_handler: 'App\Consumer\MyService'
topics:
    - batman
    - catwoman
 ```
 
### Producer

A producer will be used to send messages to the server.

In the Kafka Model, messages are sent to topics partitioned and stored on brokers.
This means that in the configuration for a producer you will have to specify the brokers and the topics.
You can optionnaly configure the log level and the strategy partitioner.

Because of RdKafka extension limitations, you cannot configure the partitions number or replication factor from the bundle. 
You must do that from the command line.

After setting your producers with their options, you will be able to produce a message using the `produce` method :

```php
$producer->produce('message', RD_KAFKA_PARTITION_UA, '12345');
```

- The first argument is the message to send.
- The second argument is the partition where to produce the message. 
By default, the value is `RD_KAFKA_PARTITION_UA` which means that the message will be sent to a random partition.
- The third argument is a key if the strategy partitioner is by key.

The `RD_KAFKA_PARTITION_UA` constant is used according the strategy partitioner.
- If the strategy partitioner is `random` (`RD_KAFKA_MSG_PARTITIONER_RANDOM`), messages are assigned to partitions randomly.
- If the stratefy partitioner is `consistent` (`RD_KAFKA_MSG_PARTITIONER_CONSISTENT`) with a key defined, messages are assigned to the partition whose the id maps the hash of the key.
If there is no key defined, messages are assigned to the same partition.

### Consumer

A consumer will be used to get a message from different topics.
You can choose to set only one topic by consumer.

In the Kafka Model, messages are consumed from topics partitioned and stored on brokers.
This means that for a consumer you will have to specify the brokers and topics in the configuration.

To consume messages, you will have to use the `consume` method to consume a message:
```php
$consumer->consume();
```
The messages will be automatically committed except if there is an error.
But you can choose not to do it by adding an argument as following:
```php
$consumer->consume(false);
```

*Note:* Setting $consumer->consume(false) boost consuming performance, avoiding to commit every single kafka consumed message.

You can decide to commit manually your message with:
```php
$consumer->commit();
```

It will commit the last consumed message.

It will give you an object `\RdKafka\Message` with information about the message : payload, topic, or partition for instance.
It is the `\RdKafka\Message` from the [RdKafka extension](https://arnaud-lb.github.io/php-rdkafka/phpdoc/book.rdkafka.html).

In case there is no more message, it will give you a _No more message_ string.
In case there is a time out, it will give you a _Time out_ string.

#### Consuming from CLI

You can use your own service to process topic messages and run it from Symfony special command provided by us.

At first you have to create your own service implementing MessageHandlerInterface or extending MessageHandlerAbstract. For example:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Service;

use Widicorp\KafkaBundle\Handler\MessageHandlerAbstract;
use RdKafka\Message;

class TestConsumer extends MessageHandlerAbstract
{

    public function process(Message $message)
    {
        echo $message->payload. PHP_EOL;
    }

}

```

Check you consumers configuration:

```yaml
consumers:
    consumer1:
        configuration:
            metadata.broker.list: '127.0.0.1'
            group.id: 'myConsumerGroup'
            enable.auto.commit: 0
        topicConfiguration:
            auto.offset.reset: 'smallest'
        timeout_consuming_queue: 200
        message_handler: 'App\Service\TestConsumer'
        topics:
            - batman
            - catwoman
```

Then you could start consuming and processing messages from batman and catwoman topics executing this command:

```
php bin/console widicorp:kafka:consume consumer1
```

Also you can add --auto-commit option to enable auto commit in every consumed message.

This Symfony command provide *signal management* too, handling SIGQUIT, SIGTERM and SIGINT to do a gracefully shutdown, committing last processed message and exiting.

### Logging Errors

By default bundle logs are disabled. If you want you could specify a custom logger service and logging level with:

```yaml
widicorp_kafka:
    logger: 
      enabled: true
      service: 'monolog.logger.user'
      level: 'info'
 ```
